### Updating from origin

After you've forked and cloned the repo, the master branch of this repository may periodically be updated with changes. To configure your local repository to receive updates, set this repository as the upstream.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/readymade-ui/fullstack-web-components.git

Verify the upstream is set.

```bash
git remote -v
```

Every time you need to sync with the changes in this repository.

Checkout the master branch.

```bash
git checkout master
```

Fetch the latest.

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

Merge the latest from upstream into master.

```bash
git merge upstream/master
```

To avoid conflicts, keep all your work on chapter branches as directed in the book.

Checkout your current branch. For example, if you're on chapter 2.

```bash
git checkout chapter-2
```

Merge the latest changes from master into your branch.

```bash
git merge master
```

Ensure dependencies are up to date. Usually the reason for updating from master is to sync with dependency upgrades.

```bash
yarn install
```

Commit the changes to the yarn.lock file.

```bash
git add yarn.lock
git commit -a -m "feat: updated dependencies"
```

Resume with the content of the book.
